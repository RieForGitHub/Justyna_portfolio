# Project 1: Audible Dataset - Data Analysis
## About
At first, I chose this project because I've been doing a lot of work on cleaning up data. But during this phase, I started asking questions about how audible sales have changed from 1998 to 2025, what kinds of audibles people like to listen to, and if there are any trends or connections between variables that could help improve sales strategies. The data for this project was obtained from [Kaggle Audible Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehangsude/audible-dataset/data).
